## Project for AT&amp;T SHAPE Hackathon April 2019
Inspired by students who are struggling academically, and report Professors’ unwilling to assist them. Even when Professors are willing to assist, many don’t have the time due heavy student load & limited office hours. Many Professors, especially Adjuncts, are unhelpful and disorganized. Teaching Assistants are underpaid, overburden and don’t have the time or resources to assist.

Maya offers an intelligent, proactive support for students to ensure optimal performance.

Built using Android Studio and IBM Watson.
